:computer: I'm a computer science student at UFRPE and I do research using Artificial Intelligence. I'm curretly working on my personal projects, and I'm 
starting to learn Data Science with a Coursera Specialization. I also like to learn web development, and here in my GitHub page you can find
the projects that I'm actually doing, and also some of my past projects from college(like evolutionary computing and text mining) and some
of my personal projects(like the web development, and the Data Science courses).
